        <p>
          Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the
          countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the
          eighteenth century. Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but
          they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated
          with specific religions.

            Over 250 people are rescued from the canyon each year. The
            difference between a great adventure in Grand Canyon and a trip to
            the hospital (or worse) is up to YOU. DO NOT attempt to hike from
            the rim to the river and back in one day, especially during the
            months of May to September. Many options are available for day
            hikers. Both the South Rim and the North Rim offer rim trail hikes
            that have spectacular views of the inner canyon, some on paved
            trails. Or you can choose to day hike into the canyon. Permits are
            not required for non-commercial day hikes. Day hiking can be a safer
            and more enjoyable choice than an overnight trip into a difficult
            area that is beyond the capabilities of any single member of your
            group.
